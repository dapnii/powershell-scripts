# Python_Deployer
Script that is meant to deploy Python 3.12.2 to many machines within domain.
I don't recommend running it as anything other than domain admin.

How to use:
1) Enter as many hostnames of the machines you want to deploy Python to as you want into the file hostnames.txt.

2) Run the script (Run with PowerShell).

4) You will get information on what's going on at the time in the script window, but if you already stopped the script and you'd like to check what was done you can go to Logs folder that will be created after running the script and check the logs. Log name will be "Transcript - date of the script start".
